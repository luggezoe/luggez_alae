Alae by Luggez is a VCV Rack plugin module that combines delay effects, Karplus-Strong resonator sounds, and feedback oscillation.

- Up to 8 parallel Karplus-Strong delay loops with multimode Biquad filters (lowpass, bandpass, highpass, notch).
- Base frequency for both pitch and filter, with a spread control to adjust pitch and filter frequency for complex timbres.
- Delay time range: 10 seconds to 6 kHz (based on a 48 kHz sample rate, adjusts with different sample rates).
- Interpolation for accurate pitch reproduction, especially at higher frequencies, minimizing audible pitch deviations.
- Decay control adjusts a frequency-dependent feedback factor for a consistent reverb time of up to 60 seconds, regardless of pitch or delay length.
- Feedback Saturation (FB-SAT) control drives the module into self-oscillation, adding overtones as the control is increased.
- Filter bypass allows for custom feedback loops using external audio sources and other VCV Rack modules.
- Pitch tracking correction parameter compensates for variations in pitch tracking due to filter type, frequency, or external feedback loops.
- CV-controllable for all key parameters.
- Right-click menu for adjusting the saturation algorithm, interpolation algorithm, and spread behavior for pitch and filter.
